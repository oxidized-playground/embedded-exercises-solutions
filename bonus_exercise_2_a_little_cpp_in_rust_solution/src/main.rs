 * Welcome to the C in Rust exercise! We prepared a small piece of code for you to complete.
 * Can you get the CCalculator to use the C Calculator library?
 *
 * If you're done, try to add the CppCalculator as a bonus exercise!
 *
 * If you're curious. Rust actually builds the C library using a build.rs file in the main dir.
 * Alternatively, you can also include a .lib file
